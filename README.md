# Blog_Admin
This is the content management system for the Blog App. The Blog App is written in three parts: a back-end written in Express NodeJS, a front-end for the content management and another React front-end which is the client side.
This part gives the admin sole authorization to perform CRUD actions on posts. The paths are:
- /sign-up
- /login
- /blogPage/dashboard - path to perform CRUD on posts
- /blogPage/logout

# Blog_API
This is the first of the three parts of the app, it is a RESTful API that allows us to write, store and retrieve the blog's data. It is the Blog app back-end. The source code can be found at [Blog_API](https://github.com/kelshuka/Blog_API.git)

# Client
This is the users front-end, built with React. Users can perform CRUD on their respective comments. The source code can be found at [Blog_Users](https://github.com/kelshuka/Blog_Users.git)
